    "# Project Description\n",
    "Our task is to learn and demonstrate the capabilities of another high-level programming language. For this project, we have decided on PySim, an opensource simulation library within the Python language. While using a code-based simulation tool versus a graphical based one has it's challenges, we aim to make a simple to follow guide to getting started with PySim. Additionally, we will provide a few workable examples to demonstrate the power of SimPy."

    "# SimPy Overview\n",
    "Created by Kalus G.Muller and Tony Vignaux and released in September 2002, SimPy is a discrete-event Python framework used for event simulation by creating a virtual environment to reflect a real-world system. This can range from simulating queueing lines at a store, virus spread through a population, a manufacturing floor, or an airport terminal. The limits to what you can simulate are only limited by the knowledge and experience of the user!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because SimPy is a descrete-event simulation library, it will be necessary to program every component of our simulation including `processes` and `events`. `Processes` represent \"customers\" in our environment, while `events` show how their interactions and how they affect the environment. We'll explore the full utilization of `processes`,`events`, and the `environment` in the User Guide section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick 3 point overview, SimPy requires three major steps:\n",
    "1. Establish the environment  \n",
    "2. Pass in the parameters  \n",
    "3. Run the simulation"

    "## Setting up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SimPy is based in python, it requires a slightly more in-depth approach to installation versus using a simple executable. We will not be covering the installation of python, if you need more help [check out it's documentation here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).  \n",
    "\n",
    "SimPy runs on Python 3 or higher, though we recommend installing the latest version for more functionality. Once you have your python installation up and running, you can install Simpy easily like any other package through pip, just use the following:  \n",
    "```pip install simpy```  \n",
    "To confirm SimPy has been installed, you can use `pip list` to view the list of installed python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have SimPy, there may be some additional libraries you'd want to add. Namely, `numpy` or `scipy` to handle random number generation, which can be added the same way we installed simpy!\n"

    "# Comparison to Arena\n",
    "## The UI\n",
    "When comparing Pysim to Arena, the first obvious note is that Pysim is code based while Arena has a flowchart based GUI. This makes Arena much more approachable for those without a coding background, such as within a business setting. Having a GUI only interface can be useful as it's easy to explore visually and find different modules while building the simulation, though it can be clunky and overwhelming. Despite this, Arena can be grasped very quickly as users navigate around the UI, reading different modules and drag+dropping their utilities. This allows simulations in arena to be built quickly and easily for anyone with a basic understanding of statistics and simulations. Contrastly Simpy's code-based approach can be intimidating to non-programmers. While it allows for easy integration into advanced models and workflows, this is heavily dependent on the developers coding abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactivity & Demo ability\n",
    "A major advantage Arena has over SimPy is it's interactivity. The ability to drag&drop modules, live run the simulation, then view customers passing between blocks is a great benefit when trying to model a demo of a simulation for clients. There is the potential to code this up from scratch in python by utilizing many external libraries, but doing so is the equivalent of riding a bike across the country instead of driving a car. Yes you CAN, but it's much more efficient to use the proper tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost\n",
    "There's not much competition from the cost perspective. Arena's professional use pricing model is expesive, with pricing information difficult to find. The most recent prices we have found put an Arena license at roughly \\\\$2,500 USD for a basic license, and \\\\$19,500 USD for a professional license. These prices were pulled from a research paper in 2011, as Arena does not make it's pricing model public. Contrastly Pysim is free for both personal and professional use, making it much more approachable for new project exploration. "

    "# Conclusions\n",
    ">Both SimPy simulation and ARENA Queueing Model could improve the airport queueing system and therefore increases the efficiency of airline operations, by reducing the waiting time via optimizing the # check-in stations and check-in workers.\n",
    "While ARENA provides graphical simulation modeling and modules templates that is visually easier to navigate and animate than the code-based SimPy, it is also far more costly than its non-proprietary counterpart which is free and open to everyone.On ther hand, SimPy requires certain Python programming aptitude in order to successfully carry out the simulation and therefore may require certain learning time beforehand.
