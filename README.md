# An Introduction to SimPy
  
In this project, we have explored the basic simulation possibilities of the SimPy library in Python. Additionally, We have created a simple aiport simulation example and a broad comparison to ARENA. Our report findings are all held within the jupyter notebook file, while the example script can be found both within the examples folder and at the following google collab link: [Airport Simulation with SimPy](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kcCbdCK4J1QS8XIiVe-ZgznUObVzv3ES?usp=sharing)
