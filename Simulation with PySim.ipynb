    "# Description of Problem\n",
    "Our task is to learn and demonstrate the capabilities of another high-level programming language. For this project, we have decided on PySim, an opensource simulation library within the Python language. While using a code-based simulation tool versus a graphical based one has it's challenges, we aim to make a simple to follow guide to getting started with PySim. Additionally, we will provide a few workable examples to demonstrate the power of SimPy."

    "## The Language  \n",
    "### The basics of SimPy\n",
    "Created by Kalus G.Muller and Tony Vignaux and released in September 2002, SimPy is a discrete-event Python framework used for event simulation by creating a virtual environment to reflect a real-world system. This can range from simulating queueing lines at a store, virus spread through a population, a manufacturing floor, or an airport terminal. The limits to what you can simulate are only limited by the knowledge and experience of the user!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because SimPy is a descrete-event simulation library, it will be necessary to program every component of our simulation including `processes` and `events`. `Processes` represent \"customers\" in our environment, while `events` show how their interactions and how they affect the environment. We'll explore the full utilization of `processes`,`events`, and the `environment` in the User Guide section.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick 3 point overview, SimPy requires three major steps:\n",
    "    1. Establish the environment  \n",
    "    2. Pass in the parameters  \n",
    "    3. Run the simulation\n",

    "to set a variety of inpubased on 1 boarding check worker, and 1 personal check scanner station. Initially we set there are 5 passengers arriving within 1-minute interval on a Poisson distribution($\\lambda =5 $), and we define the boarding check service rate to be 0.75 minute(45 seconds) on an exponential distribution($\\mu=.75$),and personal check service rate is ranging between $\\frac{1}{2}$ minute to 1 minute. After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues, where they go through the personal scanner where time is uniformly distributed between ½ minute and 1 minute. The simulation is running on a 10-minute scale with 1 simulation per cycle run in a “create-process-dispose” sequence similarly to the ARENA model process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the main program we have created two major classes: Airport and Passenger.  The Airport reclass has two process methods: boarding_check_service_time(self) and personal_check_service_time(self). In addition, a _init_(self, env) method is used to start the run process every time an instance is created for both the boarding_check process and the personal_check_process.  \n",
    "In the Passenger class we have create the following functions:\n",
    "go_to_airport(self): keep tracks of the passenger and records the arrival time at the boarding check and the personal check scanner in a chronological sequence. Under this function, there are additionally three private classes created to complete the boarding simulation process: 1) The _create_process_dispose method automatically disposes the entity and releases resources when finished. This method initiates this will triggers the go_to_airport() function in the Passenger class to have the access to start counting the passenger arrival time and pass the decision block to determine whether the passenger should use the boarding check resource or the personal check scanner resource during a waiting queue. The Resource serves as Process block and sorts the check-in processes in a FIFO(first in first out) manner.2) The _determine_resource() class classifies the resources service time based on the personal check service or the boarding check service and records the timestamp. 3) Finally the _decision_block() class creates a decision block that determines\n"

    "## Comparison to Arena\n",
    "#### The UI\n",
    "When comparing Pysim to Arena, the first obvious note is that Pysim is code based while Arena has a flowchart based GUI. This makes Arena much more approachable for those without a coding background, such as within a business setting. Having a GUI only interface can be useful as it's easy to explore visually and find different modules while building the simulation, though it can be clunky and overwhelming. Despite this, Arena can be grasped very quickly as users navigate around the UI, reading different modules and drag+dropping their utilities. This allows simulations in arena to be built quickly and easily for anyone with a basic understanding of statistics and simulations. Contrastly Simpy's code-based approach can be intimidating to non-programmers. While it allows for easy integration into advanced models and workflows, this is heavily dependent on the developers coding abilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactivity & Demo ability\n",
    "A major advantage Arena has over SimPy is it's interactivity. The ability to drag&drop modules, live run the simulation, then view customers passing between blocks is a great benefit when trying to model a demo of a simulation for clients. There is the potential to code this up from scratch in python by utilizing many external libraries, but doing so is the equivalent of riding a bike across the country instead of driving a car. Yes you CAN, but it's much more efficient to use the proper tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost\n",
    "There's not much competition from the cost perspective. Arena's professional use pricing model is expesive, with pricing information difficult to find. The most recent prices we have found put an Arena license at roughly \\\\$2,500 USD for a basic license, and \\\\$19,500 USD for a professional license. These prices were pulled from a research paper in 2011, as Arena does not make it's pricing model public. Contrastly Pysim is free for both personal and professional use, making it much more approachable for new project exploration. "
